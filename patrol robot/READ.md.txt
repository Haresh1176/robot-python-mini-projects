# 🤖 Patrol Robot Simulation

This Python project simulates a patrol robot using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The robot can patrol predefined zones, monitor its battery level, and refuse to operate if the battery is too low.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Object-Oriented Robot class (`patrol_robot`)
- Tracks robot name and battery level
- Simulates patrolling of different zones:
  - Zone A: Main Entrance
  - Zone B: Storage Area
  - Zone C: Quality Control
- Automatically reduces battery after each patrol
- Prevents patrol if battery is below 30%
- Prints live status updates during operation

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Python classes and objects
- `__init__` constructor
- `self` keyword and attributes
- Methods and conditional logic
- Battery level simulation

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python robot_patrol.py

💡 Example Output
optimus| battery is 70%
optimus preparing to patrol A
patrol zone is A:main entrance
updated battery level:45%
optimus preparing to patrol B
patrol zone is B:storage area
updated battery level:20%
optimus preparing to patrol C
Battery level is low please charge 
optimus| battery is 20%
