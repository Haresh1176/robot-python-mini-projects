# 🔋 Battery Charging Simulator

This is a beginner-level Python script that simulates a battery charging process using a while loop and simple console output. It's a great starting project to learn control flow, conditions, and time-based execution in Python.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Simulates charging from 0% to 100%
- Displays charging progress in real-time (1-second delay between each update)
- Special messages at:
  - ⚠️ 50%: Battery is halfway
  - ✅ 100%: Battery is fully charged

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Python `while` loop
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`)
- `f-strings` for formatted output
- `time.sleep()` for delays
- Basic simulation logic
